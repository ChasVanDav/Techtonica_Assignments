# As a beginner Python learner, your task is to demonstrate your ability to generate Python scripts using AI assistance. Follow these steps:

    # Choose a simple application idea, such as a basic calculator or a simple game like "Rock, Paper, Scissors".
    # Use an AI coding assistant tool (like GitHub Copilot, Kite, or Codota) to help you write the initial structure of your script.
    # Implement the following features in your script:
        # A main function that serves as the entry point
        # At least two other functions related to your chosen application (e.g., addition/subtraction functions for a calculator)
        # A loop that allows users to interact with your program multiple times
    # Write clear comments explaining each function and key parts of your code.
    # Include error handling to deal with potential input errors or unexpected situations.
    # Use proper indentation and follow Python style guidelines.
    # Test your script thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
    
    # Here's a basic structure to get you started:

            # def main():
            #     # Main function to run the program
            #     pass

            # def add_numbers(a, b):
            #     # Function to add two numbers
            #     pass

            # def subtract_numbers(a, b):
            #     # Function to subtract two numbers
            #     pass

            # # Main execution
            # if __name__ == "__main__":
            #     main()

    # Run your script and observe its output.

# Key Points to Consider:
    # Understand how AI coding assistants work and their limitations
    # Learn to write clear, descriptive comments
    # Practice error handling techniques
    # Understand the structure of Python programs, including functions and main execution block
